# When randomness comes without a seed

#### This work is heavily inspired by "_Seedless fruit is the Sweetest_ — CRYPTO/2019" by Dodis et al, which was also part of my thesis project for my bachelor degree. 

After extensive research on the subject, I've stumbled upon a couple of videos of "Coding Math" about building PseudoRandom Number Generators using JavaScript,
where they implement Middle Square Method, multiple variants of LCG, Mersenne Twister and RC4. 

So I decided to try on and build my own PRNGs using both built-in and custom methods in Python. I have also created two types of tests, one for "mathematical" reasons and one just for visual.
