# When randomness comes without a seed

#### This work is heavily inspired by "_Seedless fruit is the Sweetest_" by Dodis et al, which was also my thesis project for my bachelor degree. 

After a massive research on the subject, I've stumbled upon a couple of  of "Coding Math" about building PseudoRandom Number Generators using JavaScript,
where they implement Middle Square Method, multiple variants of LCG, Mersenne Twister and RC4. 
So I decided to try on and build my own PRNG using built-in and non methods with Python.
